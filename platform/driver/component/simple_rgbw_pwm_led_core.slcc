description: >
  The Simple RGBW PWM LED Driver provides an implementation of the Generic LED 
  API. This driver supports controlling Red/Green/Blue/White LED sets and uses 
  Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to set the intensity of each LED.


  This component includes only the Simple RGBW PWM LED driver core. To configure and create
  instances of this driver, the Simple RGBW PWM LED component should be included in the 
  project.
