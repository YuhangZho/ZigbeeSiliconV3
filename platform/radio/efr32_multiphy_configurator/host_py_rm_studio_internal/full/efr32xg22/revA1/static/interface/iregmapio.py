Register Map I/O
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The top-level device class can receive a
:class:`pyrmsvd.static.common.regmapio.RegisterMapInterface` instance,
which implements this interface. This ensures a consistent address read/write
API for the low-level access to the part, whether it is a live J-Link connection
or a simulated offline dictionary.
