"""
Phy interface file

This has been updated to handle 3 scenarios:
1) makePhy can be called inside of PHY_PHY1Example, and then if another PHY wishes to call PHY1Example the phy_name and phy_group_name will actually be set based on the highest level PHY in the call stack.
2) makePhy can be called inside of PHY_PHY1Example, and then if another PHY wishes to call PHY1Example they can optionally pass in the phy_name and phy_group_name as parameters.
3) makePhy can be called inside of a high level PHY_PHY2Example that calls PHY1Example. If makePhy is also called inside PHY1Example, then the lower level call will actually not execute and instead return the phy for PHY2Example.

This allows a lot of flexibility in how PHYs are created, and should make PHYs "just work" in most cases.
