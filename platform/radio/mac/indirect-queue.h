 * @brief Manages the pool of indirect messages. These messages cannot be
 *  transmitted until after we receive a poll message from the destination. There
 *  are 3 types of indirect messages:
 *     * Queued headers addressed to short destination addresses.
 *     * Queued headers addressed to long destination addresses.
 *     * Just-in-time (JIT) messages.
