* @brief Board support functions for Thunderboard Sense 2 (BRD4166A)
* @details The Thunderboard Sense 2 has several I2C buses connecteded to 
  the various sensors that are all connected to the EFR32. This module provides 
  functions to route pin connections of an I2C peripheral to the various 
  I2C buses. This allows time multiplexed access to several 
  I2C buses using only one I2C peripheral.
