description=This code is for a Trust Center, and will periodically initiate a NWK key update based on the parameters defined below.  It uses either a Broadcast based method, or a Unicast based method depending on whether the 'Trust Center NWK Key Update Broadcast' or 'Trust Center NWK Key Update Unicast' plugin has been included.  NOTE: The default value of 30 minutes for Key Update Period/Units is to ensure that the network key update operation is observed and verified during development and test.  This value should be changed for production deployment; Zigbee R22 recommends a period of no less than 30 days.  The upper bound of 45 days reflects a constraint of this plugin's timing implementation.  If support for longer periods is required, the timing implementation and option ranges of this plugin must be modified.
