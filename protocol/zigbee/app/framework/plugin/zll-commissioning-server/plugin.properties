rxOnAtStartupPeriod.name=Rx On at Startup time (in seconds)
rxOnAtStartupPeriod.description=The duration, in seconds, for which the plugin will keep the radio receiver switched on at application startup, in order to listen for incoming scan requests. A duration of zero will disable this feature.
rxOnAtStartupPeriod.type=NUMBER:0,3600
rxOnAtStartupPeriod.default=300
rxOnAtStartupPeriod.enabledIf=!rxAlwaysOn

rxAlwaysOn.name=Rx always on
rxAlwaysOn.description=Indicates whether the radio receiver should be permanently on, when the device is available for touchlinking. (Note that the radio will still be switched off for a sleepy end device while it is joined to a network)
rxAlwaysOn.type=BOOLEAN
rxAlwaysOn.default=FALSE

defaultRadioChannel.name=Default radio channel
defaultRadioChannel.description=The radio channel used by a factory new device to listen for incoming scan requests, and, if the device is a router, to form a new network on receipt of a Network Start request.
defaultRadioChannel.type=NUMBER:11,26
defaultRadioChannel.default=11

stealingAllowed.name=Stealing Allowed
stealingAllowed.description=Indicates whether a non-factory-new device may be touchlinked. (Note, in conformance with the Zigbee 3.0 Base Device Behaviour specification, all joined devices are considered non-factory-new from a touchlink point of view, including devices which automatically form a network on startup, e.g. by using emberZllFormNetwork. For such devices, stealing may be allowed by default at startup, but then subsequently forbidden on a successful touchlink, by calling emberZllSetPolicy.)
stealingAllowed.type=BOOLEAN
stealingAllowed.default=TRUE

remoteResetAllowed.name=Reset Allowed
remoteResetAllowed.description=Indicates whether a non-factory-new device may be reset remotely. (Note, in conformance with the Zigbee 3.0 Base Device Behaviour specification, all joined devices are considered non-factory-new from a touchlink point of view, including devices which automatically form a network on startup, e.g. by using emberZllFormNetwork. For such devices, remote reset may be allowed by default at startup, but then subsequently forbidden on a successful touchlink, by calling emberZllSetPolicy.)
remoteResetAllowed.type=BOOLEAN
remoteResetAllowed.default=TRUE
