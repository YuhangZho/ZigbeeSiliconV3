touchLinkSecondsDelay.name=Touch link delay time (in seconds)
touchLinkSecondsDelay.description=The duration, in seconds, for which the plugin will wait before sending a network form or start to a target device.  The user may abort the touch link procedure during this delay if, for example, the wrong target device has been selected.
touchLinkSecondsDelay.type=NUMBER:1,255
touchLinkSecondsDelay.default=1

subDeviceTableSize.name=Sub-device table size
subDeviceTableSize.description=The maximum number of sub-devices (endpoints) discovered on remote nodes.  The plugin will attempt to retrieve device information records from each sub-device on the remote node during touch linking, up to this limit.
subDeviceTableSize.type=NUMBER:1,255
subDeviceTableSize.default=1

scanPowerLevel.name=Scan Power Level
scanPowerLevel.description=The power level used to transmit the scan request messages by the initiator device during touch linking.  The Base Device Behaviour specification requires a nominal output power of 0dBm during touch linking.
scanPowerLevel.type=POWER
scanPowerLevel.default=0

identifyDuration.name=ZLL identify duration
identifyDuration.description=The amount of time (in seconds) the recipient is to remain in identify mode when an identify request command frame, used to request the recipient to identify itself in some application specific way to aid with touchlinking, is received. If set to 0 (0x0000), the recipient will exit identify mode. If set to 65535 (0xFFFF), the recipient will remain in identify mode for a default time known by the receiver. The field is set to 65535 (0xFFFF) by default.
identifyDuration.type=NUMBER:1,65535
identifyDuration.default=65535
