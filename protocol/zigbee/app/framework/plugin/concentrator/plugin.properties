name=Concentrator Support
category=Utility
description=Code that handles periodically broadcasting a many-to-one-route-request (MTORR) so that the device will act as a concentrator (sink) in the network. Note: NCP/SOC source route table size can be now defined as part of the source routing library.

concentratorType.name=Concentrator Type
concentratorType.description=The type of concentrator that the node will advertise itself as.  A low ram concentrator will receive route record messages every time a device wishes to send to it.  A high ram concentrator will only receive route record messages after a new MTORR broadcast.
concentratorType.type=LIST:LowRamConcentrator, HighRamConcentrator
concentratorType.default=LowRamConcentrator


minTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.name=Minimum Time between broadcasts (in seconds)
minTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.description=The minimum amount of time that must pass between MTORR broadcasts.
minTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.type=NUMBER:1,60
minTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.default=10

maxTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.name=Maximum Time between broadcasts (in seconds)
maxTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.description=The maximum amount of time that can pass between MTORR broadcasts.
maxTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.type=NUMBER:30,300
maxTimeBetweenBroadcastsSeconds.default=60

routeErrorThreshold.name=Route Error Threshold
routeErrorThreshold.description=The number of route errors that will trigger a re-broadcast of the MTORR.
routeErrorThreshold.type=NUMBER:1,100
routeErrorThreshold.default=3

deliveryFailureThreshold.name=Delivery Failure Threshold
deliveryFailureThreshold.description=The number of APS delivery failures that will trigger a re-broadcast of the MTORR.
deliveryFailureThreshold.type=NUMBER:1,100
deliveryFailureThreshold.default=1

maxHops.name=Maximum number of hops for Broadcast
maxHops.description=The maximum number of hops that the MTORR broadcast will be allowed to have.  A value of 0 will be converted to the EMBER_MAX_HOPS value set by the stack.
maxHops.type=NUMBER:0,30
maxHops.default=0

defaultRouterBehavior.name=Default concentrator router behavior
defaultRouterBehavior.description=This sets the initial value for the concentrator router behavior. The behavior can be set at runtime with emberAfPluginConcentratorSetRouterBehaviorCommand.
defaultRouterBehavior.type=LIST:NONE,FULL
defaultRouterBehavior.default=FULL
