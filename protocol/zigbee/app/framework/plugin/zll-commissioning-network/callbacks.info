 *
 * This callback is called by the ZLL Commissioning Network plugin when a joinable
 * network has been found. If the application returns true, the plugin will
 * attempt to join the network. Otherwise, the plugin will ignore the network
 * and continue searching. Applications can use this callback to implement a
 * network blacklist. Note that this callback is not called during touch
 * linking.
