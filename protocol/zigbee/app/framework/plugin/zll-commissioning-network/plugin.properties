# Description of the plugin.
description=(NOTE: This plugin is deprecated as it is not compliant to Zigbee 3.0 requirements. See Network Creator and Network Steering plugins instead for Zigbee 3.0-compliant implementations of this behavior.) Provides legacy Zigbee Light Link 1.0 implementation of routines for finding and joining any viable network via scanning, rather than joining a specific network.

joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.name=Joinable scan timeout (minutes)
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.description=The amount of time (in minutes) that the plugin will wait during a joinable network scan for the application to determine if the network joined to by the plugin is correct.  If the application leaves the network during this time, the plugin will automatically continue searching for other joinable networks.  If set to zero, the application will be unable to resume a joinable network search after successfully joining to a network.
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.type=NUMBER:0,5
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.default=1

extendedPanId.name=Extended PAN ID
extendedPanId.description=The extended PAN ID to use when forming or joining networks using API's in this plugin.  If the extended PAN ID is set to all zeros, a random value will be used when forming and any network will be considered when joining.
extendedPanId.type=EUI64
extendedPanId.default=00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
