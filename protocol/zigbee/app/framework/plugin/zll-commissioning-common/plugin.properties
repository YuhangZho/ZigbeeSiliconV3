primaryChannelMask.name=Primary channel mask
primaryChannelMask.description=Defines the primary channel set to be used for touchlink commissioning and related operations.  The primary channel set will always be used during touch linking or when searching for joinable, non-ZLL networks.  The Base Device Behaviour specification defines the primary channel set as consisting of channels 11, 15, 20 and 25.
primaryChannelMask.type=CHANNELS
primaryChannelMask.default=0x02108800UL

scanSecondaryChannels.name=Scan secondary channels
scanSecondaryChannels.description=If this option is enabled, the plugin will scan the secondary channel set if no networks are found on a primary channel during a touchlink operation, or when searching for joinable, non-ZLL networks. This option will increase the scanning time but will potentially find more devices or networks.
scanSecondaryChannels.type=BOOLEAN
scanSecondaryChannels.default=TRUE

secondaryChannelMask.name=Secondary channel mask
secondaryChannelMask.description=Defines the secondary channel set to be used for touchlink commissioning and related operations. The Base Device Behaviour specification defines the secondary channel set as consisting of 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 26.
secondaryChannelMask.type=CHANNELS
secondaryChannelMask.default=0x05EF7000UL
secondaryChannelMask.dependsOn=scanSecondaryChannels

radioTxPower.name=Radio transmit power
radioTxPower.description=The radio transmit power (in dBm) at which the node will operate.
radioTxPower.type=POWER
radioTxPower.default=3

zigbee3Support.name=ZigBee 3.0 Support
zigbee3Support.description= Enabling this option (the default for Zigbee 3.0) will set the Profile Interop bit in the Touchlink information field for ZLL commissioning cluster commands for both initiators and targets, and will cause Scan Response and Device Information Response messages to use the actual profile id specified in the endpoint, rather than the legacy ZLL profile id.
zigbee3Support.type=BOOLEAN
zigbee3Support.default=TRUE
