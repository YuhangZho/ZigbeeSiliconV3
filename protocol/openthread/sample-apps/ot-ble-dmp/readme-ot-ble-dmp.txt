1 Introduction
--------------

This README is a duplicate of AN1265: Dynamic Multiprotocol Development with
Bluetooth and OpenThread in GSDK v3.x.

This application note provides instructions on getting started with
dynamic multiprotocol (DMP) applications using OpenThread and Bluetooth running
over the FreeRTOS real time operating system.

The sample application ot-ble-dmp is a test application that demonstrates
the components that go into building a DMP application. It provides a command
line interface (CLI) that allow the user to execute basic OpenThread and
Bluetooth commands. It also demonstrates how the power manager component
can be used to allow the device to enter into low power (EM2) mode in
betwen activities.

The term 'dynamic' in DMP refers to the fact that both protocols are operating
simultaneously. The radio scheduler takes care of multiplexing the the
transmitted and received packets over the radio. For more information on
how the radio scheduler works, see UG305: Dynamic Multiprotocol User’s Guide.

This document assumes that you have installed Simplicity Studio 5 (SSv5) and the
OpenThread and Bluetooth SDKs, and that you are familiar with SSv5 and
configuring, building, and flashing applications. If not, see QSG170:
Silicon Labs OpenThread Quick Start Guide.


1.1 Hardware Requirements
--------------------------

- An EFR32 chip with at least 512 kB of flash.


2 Building the ot-ble-dmp Sample App
------------------------------------

Precompiled demo application images are provided with the Gecko SDK Suite 3.0,
compatible with:

- brd4161a
- brd4166a
- brd4168a
- brd4180a
- brd4304a

To get started quickly, In the Simplicity Studio 5 (SSv5) Launcher Perspective
go to the DEMOS tab. Find the ot-ble-dmp demo and click RUN. This uploads the
application image to your board.

To build the ot-ble-dmp sample app from source, you will need SSv5 and the
Gecko SDK 3.x development environment with the following packages installed:

- OpenThread SDK 1.x
- Bluetooth SDK 3.x

The GNU ARM toolchain is installed with SSv5. The IAR-EWARM toolchain is not compatible with OpenThread.

1.	With your target development hardware connected, open SSv5’s File menu and select New > Silicon Labs Project Wizard. The Target, SDK, and Toolchain Selection dialog opens. Your target hardware should be populated. Click NEXT.

2.	The Example Project Selection dialog opens. Use the Technology Type and Keyword filters to search for a specific example, in this case ot-ble-dmp. Select it and click NEXT.

Note that, if you do not see the application, your connected hardware may not be compatible. To verify, in the Launcher Per-spectives My Products view enter EFR32MGxx and select one of the boards. Go to the Examples tab, filter by Thread tech-nology  and verify you can see the app. 

3.	The Project Configuration dialog opens. Here you can rename your project, change the default project file location, and de-termine if you will link to or copy project files. Note that if you change any linked resource, it is changed for any other project that references it. Unless you know you want to modify SDK resources, use the default selection. Click FINISH.

The Simplicity IDE opens with the ot-ble-dmp project open in the Project Configurator. You may now build the project. For those used to Simplicity Studio 4, no generation step is necessary because it is done automatically. The ot-ble-dmp.s37 image will be located in the GNU ARM 7.2.x directory, and may be uploaded to your board using an SSv5 tool such as the flash programmer or Simplicity Commander.


3 CLI commands
--------------

If you have used the ot-cli-ftd sample application, the OpenThread commands
available in the ot-ble-dmp app are identical. Type help at the prompt to
see a list. A complete OpenThread CLI reference is available here:

https://github.com/openthread/openthread/blob/master/src/cli/README.md

A quick tutorial on using the CLI to form a two node OpenThread network
and send a ping is available here:

https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/master/examples/apps/cli

The ot-ble-dmp app adds a set of bluetooth commands that can be used to
exercise the bluetooth stack. Type "ble" at the prompt to see a list of
subcommands:

get_address
create_adv_set
set_adv_timing
set_adv_random_address
start_adv
stop_adv
start_discovery
set_conn_timing
conn_open
conn_close

These commands are implmented in the bluetooth_cli.c file, and each of them
calls a corresponding Bluetooth C API function.  For detailed documentation
on the underlying functions, see https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest.
Note that the C API prefixes for the Bluetooth SDK changed from gecko_ to
sl_bt_ in version 3.0. See AN1255: Transitioning  from the v2.x to the v3.x
Bluetooth® SDK for more information about this and other BGAPI changes. 

ble get_address
- Prints out the public bluetooth address
- Example: "ble get_address"
- Calls sl_bt_system_get_identity_address()

ble create_adv_set
- Create an advertising set. Must be called to obtain a handle for use in the
  other advertising commands.
- Example: "ble create_adv_set"

- Calls sl_bt_connection_open()

ble conn_close <handle>
- Closes a Bluetooth connection
- Example: "ble conn_close 0"
- Calls sl_bt_connection_close()


3.1 Establishing a Bluetooth connection between two nodes
---------------------------------------------------------

To establish a Bluetooth connection, the client starts advertising on 
advertising set 0 with modes discoverable and connectable.  The server
connects using the client's public address.

CLIENT:
> ble create_adv_set
ble create_adv_set
success handle=0
>
> ble start_adv 0 2 2
ble start_adv 0 2 2
success
> 
> ble get_address
ble get_address
BLE address: 90fd9f7b5d39

SERVER:
> ble conn_open 90fd9f7b5d39 0
ble conn_open 90fd9f7b5d39 0
success
> 
> BLE connection opened handle=1 address=90fd9f7b5d39 address_type=1 master=1 advertising_set=255
BLE connection parameters handle=1 interval=40 latency=0 timeout=100 security_mode=0 txsize=27
BLE event: 0x40800a0
BLE event: 0x900a0
BLE connection parameters handle=1 interval=40 latency=0 timeout=100 security_mode=0 txsize=251


4 Important Software Components and Files
-----------------------------------------

With the ot-ble-dmp project open in Project Configurator, click the Software Components tab to see all of the software compo-nents in the Component Library. Filter on Installed Components to see the components used in the project. Four key component categories pertain to building a DMP application:

- Bluetooth components
- OpenThread components
- Rail Multiprtocol library component (under Radio)
- FreeRTOS components (under Third Party)

You need to include these components in any project to add OpenThread and Bluetooth DMP functionality.

When the FreeRTOS component is added to a project, the Universal Configurator
automatically takes care of adding adaptation layers necessary to run the
OpenThread and Bluetooth stacks over FreeRTOS. These adaptation files are
located in the gecko_sdk_3.0/protocol/openthread/platform-abstraction/rtos
directory and are named:

- sl_bt_freertos_abstraction.c
- sl_ot_freertos_abstraction.c

The three application source files for this project (the only source files that
are not part of an SDK component) are stored at the top level of the project and
are named:

- main.c
- bluetooth_cli.c
- bluetooth_event_handler.c


4.1 The Main Function and Initialization
----------------------------------------

The main() function, located in main.c, is very simple:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  otrInit(argc, argv);
  vTaskStartScheduler();
  return 0;
}

The call to otrInit(), which is defined in sl_ot_freertos_abstraction.c,
takes care of initializing the entire system, including the OpenThread stack 
and the Bluetooth stack, and creating the necessary FreeRTOS tasks to run them.
The call to vTaskStartScheduler() starts the FreeRTOS scheduler.

The application can perform any necessary initialization steps within the
sl_ot_rtos_application_init() callback. In the ot-ble-dmp application, this
consists of setting up the CLI, and making a power manager call that will
be discussed below.


4.2 FreeRTOS Tasks
------------------

Three FreeRTOS tasks are created by default:

- OpenThread task, also used by the application (priority 2)
- Bluetooth task (priority 4)
- Bluetooth link layer task (priority 5)

The OpenThread task is created in sl_ot_freertos_adaptation.c, and the
Bluetooth tasks are created in sl_bt_freertos_adaptation.c.

Silicon Labs Bluetooth has a serialized API which allows for commands and
events to be passed between RTOS tasks in a thread-safe manner.  OpenThread
does not have a serialized API.  For this reason, it is most convenient for
the application logic to run in the OpenThread task. An application tick callback
is provided for this purpose, and is called from within the OpenThread task's
run loop: sl_ot_rtos_application_tick(). The ot-ble-dmp app includes a simple
implementation of the tick callback in the main.c file.

OpenThread API calls made from within the application tick are thread-safe
because they are executed within the OpenThread task. Because the Bluetooth
API is serialized, Bluetooth API calls may be made from any task.  The
Bluetooth task is responsible  for consuming and processing these serialized
events. This happens transparently to the application.


4.3 Handling Bluetooth Events
-----------------------------

Bluetooth events are dispatched to the application via the sl_bt_on_event()
callback. For the ot-ble-dmp app, an implementation  of this callback is
located in bluetooth_event_callback.c. This example handler simply prints out
some information about the event. In a real application, these events would
be processed by application handlers.

To check for Bluetooth events ready to be processed, the ot-ble-dmp application
by default calls sl_bt_event_handler_tick() within the application
tick function in main.c. This function checks for waiting Bluetooth events,
and in turn calls the sl_bt_on_event() callback if necessary. Using
the sl_bt_event_handler_tick() from within sl_ot_rtos_application_tick()
means that the Bluetooth event callback is executed within the same task
as the application tick code. This simplifies application code since there
is no need to worry about thread safety.

Another way to process Bluetooth events is within a dedicated Bluetooth
Event Handler task.  This is a separate task whose sole purpose is to check
for waiting Bluetooth events, and call sl_bt_on_event() when they become
available. This task is automatically created during initialization if the
macro SL_BT_DISABLE_EVENT_TASK is not defined.  In this case, calling
sl_bt_event_handler_tick() from the application is not necessary.
Since the ot-ble-dmp application SL_BT_DISABLE_EVENT_TASK within the
ot-ble-dmp.slcp file, a separate event handler task is not created.


4.4 Power Manager Integration
-----------------------------

The ot-ble-dmp application also includes the Power Manager component, which
is responsible for putting the system to sleep when possible.

The Power Manager component includes seamless FreeRTOS integration.
It runs automatically from within the FreeRTOS Idle Task. When all tasks
have yielded (because they are pending on some event to continue processing),
the Idle Task runs, and the power manager code can then put the system to sleep.

The application informs the power manager what sleep level it would like by
adding and removing energy requirements via the API calls
sl_power_manager_add_em_requirement() and
sl_power_manager_remove_em_requirement().  Adding an EM1 requirement tells
the Power Manager that the lowest energy level allowed is EM1, which only
idles the processor and does not go to sleep.  Removing the EM1 requirement
allows the power manager to enter energy level EM2, which is deep sleep.
See the reference for your MCU on https://docs.silabs.com/ under
Modules > Platform Services > Power Manager.


5 OpenThread Sleepy End Device Demo
-----------------------------------

The ot-ble-dmp app starts out by adding an EM1 requirement during
initialization, in the sl_ot_rtos_application_init() callback.
This prevents the device from going into EM2 sleep mode, so that
the CLI is responsive and the user can enter commands.

To demonstrate an OpenThread Sleepy End Device, first form a two node OpenThread
network by following the instructions at:
https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/master/examples/apps/cli

Next, on the device that joined the network (not the leader),
type the following comands:

> mode s
> pollperiod 1000

The mode command puts the device into sleepy child mode.  The pollperiod
command tells the child to send data polls once every second.  At this point
the child is still not sleeping, and the CLI is still responsive.

Pressing either button PB0 or PB1 on the WSTK development board will toggle
the energy mode requirement. The child will start sleeping in EM2 mode in
between data polls, and the CLI will no longer be responsive. You can verify
that the child is still able to send and receive messages by sending a
ping from the leader node. There will be up to one second of latency due
to the child's sleep cycle.  Pressing either button again will bring the
device out of EM2 so that the CLI can be used.

To monitor the power consumption of the device while performing the above
steps, use the Energy Profiler tool in Simplicity Studio to connect to the
device and start an energy capture.  See UG343: Multi-Node Energy Profiler
User’s Guide for more information about the Energy Profiler.
