description: >
  A heap implementation for FreeRTOS.

  A sample implementation of pvPortMalloc() and vPortFree() that permits
  allocated blocks to be freed, but does not combine adjacent free blocks
  into a single larger block (and so will fragment memory).  See heap_4.c for
  an equivalent that does combine adjacent blocks into single larger blocks.
